        <h2 class="h2-red">Who I am ?</h2>
        <p id="p-space">A bite from a spider somehow granted teenager Peter Parker its arachnid abilities and instead of using them for personal gain, he decided to help others with them.
        An orphan living with his aunt, May Parker, the boy chose to wear a mask while fighting crime so as not to burden her with his actions.
        Calling himself Spider-Man and sporting a pair of web-shooting devices he’d constructed, Parker wound up in internet videos which attracted the attention of Tony Stark.
        The billionaire industrialist deduced Spider-Man’s secret identity and approached Parker at his and May’s home in Queens, New York with a request for aid from the hero in an upcoming confrontation with Captain America and a group of other rogue Avengers and associates.
        Parker was initially hesitant to even admit his secret career as Spider-Man, but the thrill of adventure and Stark’s talk of responsibility drew him in and he accepted the invitation, as well as a new, high-tech costume and web-shooters.</p>

        <h2 id="h2-white">My biggest ennemy</h2>
        <p id="p-space">Norman is raised by an abusive and alcoholic father who lost the family fortune.
        Maybe this was the impetus for Norman to become a self-made man, as he grows up to be a ruthless industrialist.
        He is the co-owner of the leading New York firm, Osborn Industries (AKA Oscorp), which specializes in chemical manufacturing via Osborn Chemicals, as well as other areas of research and development, including robotics.
        Norman’s wife Emily dies within a year of their son Harry’s birth, leaving Norman embittered. Unfortunately, this causes him to repeat the sins of his own father and Norman raises Harry dispassionately, often devoid of fatherly warmth, frustrated by Harry’s failure to demonstrate academic excellence or a competitive drive.
        Despite living in opulence, Harry feels depressed and neglected by his father. Early in his career, before he ever becomes the Green Goblin, Norman resorts to criminal means to advance his agenda.
        When Norman faces opposition from the owners of Malone’s flophouse, who refuse to sell so that Osborn could build a warehouse, Osborn sends the Enforcers— “Fancy” Dan Brito, Montana, and the Ox (AKA Raymond Bloch)—to violently persuade them.
        Namor the Sub-Mariner, now a homeless amnesiac, retaliates by destroying Osborn’s construction equipment.
        Private detective Mac Gargan (later Scorpion and Venom) steals military robotics plans from Osborn for competitor Obadiah Stane, causing Osborn Industries to lose a lucrative contract.</p>
